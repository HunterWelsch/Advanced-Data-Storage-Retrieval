Module 9 work and Challenge

June has more days with percipitation then Decmeber, but December has a high total amount of percipititon. Allowing us to infer that it rains for longer and/or harder durations durign a day in December than in June. Further analysis is need to confrim or deny that hypothesis, such as inches of percipation per hour. As far analysis that will impact the amount of people at the beach I would analyze the heat index and tides.
